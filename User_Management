# User Management for the Police Station DB

* Description

* To maintain data security and role-specific access, this database implements role-based user management using MySQL's CREATE USER and GRANT statements.

  * Admin (admin_user)
    Has full privileges to manage the entire database. This includes creating, updating, and deleting any data, as well as performing maintenance and schema changes.

  * Duty Officer
    This user has permission to log new case records, update ongoing case information, and view officer and criminal data. 

    This user plays an active role in the day-to-day operations.

  * Investigator
    Has read-only access to case records, assigned criminals, and investigation details. 
    
    This role ensures that investigators can view necessary data without making unapproved changes.

# Creating the users
-- Step 1: Create the users

-- Admin user (full access)
CREATE USER 'admin_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'AdminPass123!';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON police_station_db.* TO 'admin_user'@'localhost';

-- Duty Officer (can insert and update cases and view relevant info)
CREATE USER 'duty_officer'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'DutyPass123!';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON police_station_db.CaseRecord TO 'duty_officer'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON police_station_db.Officer TO 'duty_officer'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON police_station_db.Criminal TO 'duty_officer'@'localhost';

-- Investigator (can only view assigned cases and related records)
CREATE USER 'investigator'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'InvestigatorPass123!';
GRANT SELECT ON police_station_db.CaseRecord TO 'investigator'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON police_station_db.CaseCriminal TO 'investigator'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON police_station_db.Criminal TO 'investigator'@'localhost';

-- Step 2: (Optional) Prevent users from accessing other databases
-- This is automatically handled in modern MySQL if you grant specific schema access only.

-- Step 3: Flush privileges (optional in most cases but safe to include)
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
